<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Those friends who have taken an interest in my literary productions
may feel some surprise at my appearance in the character of a
translator of Sanscrit poetry. To those, and indeed to all who may
take up the present volume, I owe some explanation of my pretensions
as a faithful interpreter of my original text. Those pretensions are
very humble; and I can unfeignedly say, that if the field had been
likely to be occupied by others, who might unite poetical powers with
a profound knowledge of the sacred language of India, I should have
withdrawn at once from the competition. But, in fact, in this country
the students of oriental literature, endowed with a taste and feeling
for poetry, are so few in number, that any attempt to make known the
peculiar character of those remarkable works, the old mythological
epics of India, may be received with indulgence by all who are
interested in the history of poetry. Mr. Wilson alone, since Sir W.
Jones, has united a poetical genius with deep Sanscrit scholarship;
but he has in general preferred the later and more polished
period&mdash;that of Kalidasa and the dramatists&mdash;to the ruder, yet in my
opinion, not less curious and poetical strains of the older epic
bards.</p>

<p>A brief account of the manner in which I became engaged in these
studies, will best explain the extent of my proficiency. During the
two last years in which I held the office of Professor of Poetry in
the University of Oxford, having exhausted the subject which I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span> had
chosen for my terminal course, I was at a loss for some materials for
the few remaining lectures before my office should expire. I had been
led by the ardent curiosity, which I have ever felt to acquire some
knowledge of the poetry of all ages and nations&mdash;to examine some of
the publications of French and German, as well as English scholars, on
the subject of Indian poetry; chiefly those of the Schlegels, of Bopp,
and of De Chezy. I was struck with the singularity and captivated by
the extreme beauty, as it appeared to me, of some of the extracts,
especially those from the great epic poems, the Mahabharata and the
Ramayana, in their Homeric simplicity so totally opposite to the
ordinary notions entertained of all eastern poetry. I was induced to
attempt, without any instruction, and with the few elementary works
which could be procured, the Grammars of Wilkins and Bopp, the
Glossaries of Bopp and Rosen (Mr. Wilson's Dictionary was then out of
print and could not be purchased), to obtain some knowledge of this
wonderful and mysterious language. The study grew upon me, and would
have been pursued with more ardour, perhaps with more success, but for
the constant interruption of more imperative professional and literary
avocations. In itself the Sanscrit is an inexhaustible subject of
interest; in its grammatical structure more regular, artificial, and
copious than the most perfect of the western languages; in its origin,
the parent from which the older Greek, the Latin and the Teutonic
tongues seem to branch out and develop themselves upon distinct and
discernible principles.</p>

<p>I ventured to communicate to the Members of the University who
attended my lectures, my discoveries, as it were, in the unknown
region of Indian poetry, and to introduce translations of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span> such
passages as appeared to me of peculiar singularity or beauty. Though I
was still moving in the leading-strings of my learned guides, I had
obtained sufficient acquaintance with the language to compare their
interpretations with the original text. I afterwards embodied some
parts of my lectures in an article in the Quarterly Review, in order
to contribute as far as was in my power to open this new and almost
untrodden field of literature to the English reader.</p>

<p>Still I should not have presumed to form these translations into a
separate work, nor acceded to the proposal of the publisher of the
present volume, who has himself deserved so well of the students of
oriental lore by his excellent translation, or rather recomposition of
Adelung's "Historical Sketch of Sanscrit Literature," but for the
encouragement and assistance of Mr. Wilson, now, the University may be
proud to say, the Boden Professor of Sanscrit at Oxford. To his most
friendly care in revising these sheets, I owe the correction of many
errors; and Sanscrit scholars will find in the notes some observations
on the text, which will contribute to elucidate the poem of Nala.
Under the sanction of Mr. Wilson's revision, I may venture to hope
that the translation is, at least, an accurate version of the
original; and I cannot too strongly express my gratitude for the
labour which Mr. Wilson has been so kind as to expend on my imperfect
and unpretending work.</p>

<p>The versification, or rather the metrical system, which I have
adopted, is an experiment, how far a successful one must be judged by
others. The original verse in which the vast epics of Vyasa and
Valmiki are composed is called the Sloka, which is thus described by
Schlegel in his Indische Bibliothek, p. 36: "The oldest, most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span> simple,
and most generally adopted measure is the Sloka; a distich of two
sixteen syllable-lines, divided at the eighth syllable." According to
our prosodial marks, the following is the scheme:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><img src="images/image_02.jpg" alt="Prosidial Marks" width="398" height="92" /></p>



<p>The first four syllables are bound by no rule; the second half, on the
contrary, is unalterably fixed, excepting that the last syllable has
the common licence of termination. In the second half verse, I do not
remember a single instance of deviation from this, though sometimes,
but very seldom, the first half verse ends with another quadrisyllable
foot. The reader who is curious on the subject, may compare Mr.
Colebrooke's elaborate essays on Sanscrit poetry, Kosegarten's preface
to his Translation of Nala, and Bopp's preface to his Translation of
Selections from the Mahabharata.</p>

<p>In the first translations which I attempted, a few passages from the
Bhagavat-Gita, I adhered as nearly as possible to the measure of the
original; in the Nala, in order to give the narrative a more easy and
trochaic flow, I omitted one syllable, and in some degree changed the
structure of the verse.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>The episode of Nala is extracted from the Vanaparvam, the third part
of the Mahabharata, the great Indian poem, which contains 100,000
slokas, or distichs. The sage, Vrihadasva, relates the story of Nala
to king Yudishthira, in order to console him under the miseries to
which he was exposed by bad success in play. By the terms of the
gaming transaction, in which he was worsted by Sakuni, who threw the
dice for Duryodhana, he was condemned to wander with his brothers for
twelve years in the forest. The adventures of Nala showed how that
king, having been in the same manner unfortunate with the dice, had
suffered still greater toil and misery, and had at length recovered
his kingdom and his wife. The popularity of this fable with the
natives, is sufficiently proved by the numerous poetic versions of the
story. The Nalodaya, a poem ascribed to Kalidas, should first be
mentioned. A new edition of this work has been recently published by
Ferdinand Benary; we have a notice of it in the Quarterly Review: it
seems to bear the same relation to the simple and national episode of
the Mahabharata, as the seicentesti of Italy to Dante or Ar&igrave;osto, or
Gongora to the poem of the Cid. Another poem called Naishadha, in
twenty-two books, does not complete the story, but only carries it as
far as the fifteenth book. There is a Tamulic version of the same
story, translated by Kindersley, in his specimens of Hindu Literature.
The third book of the poem of Sriharsha, containing 135 slokas, is
entirely occupied with the conversation between Damayanti and the
swans (the geese), in which the birds to excite her love, dwell with
diffuse eloquence on the praises of Nala.</p>

<span class="i0">Whichsoe'er the form she gazed on&mdash;him her Nala, him she thought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She within her secret spirit&mdash;deeply pondering, stood and thought:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"How shall I the gods distinguish?&mdash;royal Nala how discern?"<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span><span class="i0">Pondering thus Vidarbha's maiden&mdash;in the anguish of her heart&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th' attributes of the immortals&mdash;sought, as heard of yore, to see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Th' attributes of each celestial&mdash;that our aged sires describe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As on earth they stand before me&mdash;not of one may I discern."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long she pondered in her silence&mdash;and again, again she thought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the gods, her only refuge&mdash;turned she at this trying hour.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her voice and with her spirit&mdash;she her humble homage paid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Folding both her hands and trembling&mdash;to the gods the maiden spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"As when heard the swan's sweet language&mdash;chose I then Nishadha's king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By this truth I here adjure ye&mdash;oh, ye gods, reveal my lord;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On the earth Nishadha's monarch&mdash;stood confessed, with twinkling eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the gods an instant gazed she&mdash;then upon the king of men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of right king Bhima's daughter&mdash;named Nishadha's king her lord.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span><span class="i0">Modestly the large-eyed maiden&mdash;lifted up his garment's hem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round his shoulders threw she lightly&mdash;the bright zone of radiant flowers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So she chose him for her husband&mdash;Nala, that high-hearted maid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then alas! alas! burst wildly,&mdash;from that conclave of the kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And "well done, well done," as loudly&mdash;from the gods and sages broke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All in their extatic wonder&mdash;glorified Nishadha's king.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to royal Damayanti&mdash;Virasena's kingly son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To that slender waisted damsel&mdash;spake he comfort in his joy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Since thou'st own'd me for thine husband&mdash;in the presence of the gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thy faithful consort know me&mdash;aye delighting in thy words.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While this spirit fills this body&mdash;maiden with the smile serene!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thine am I, so long thine only&mdash;this the solemn truth I vow."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus he gladdened Damayanti&mdash;with the assurance of his faith;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the happy pair devoutly<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>&mdash;worshipped then the present gods.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Chosen thus Nishadha's monarch&mdash;the bright guardians of the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In their gladness all on Nala&mdash;eight transcendant gifts bestowed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To discern the visible godhead&mdash;in the sacrifice, a gait<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Firm and noble, Sachi's husband&mdash;Indra to king Nala gave.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Hasten, Nala!" oft and loudly&mdash;"Punyasloka, haste," it cried.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Fear thou not," king Nala answered&mdash;plunging in the ruddy flame;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Can she speak thus, Damayanti&mdash;thus with sorrow frantic act?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Wrong'd by me, her basest husband&mdash;miserable, mind-estranged!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fickle is the heart of woman&mdash;grievous too is my offence!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence she thus might act ignobly&mdash;in her exile, reft of friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soul-disturbed by her great sorrow&mdash;in the excess of her despair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No! she could not thus have acted&mdash;she with noble offspring blest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the truth, and where the falsehood&mdash;setting forth, I best shall judge,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As he gazed upon those coursers&mdash;spoke the king, almost in wrath:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">How will these my coursers bear us&mdash;slight in strength and slightly breathed&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Answered thus by noble Nala&mdash;then Bhangasuri the king,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Gazing on that tree, the raja&mdash;spake to Vahuca in haste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Now, O charioteer, in numbers, thou shalt see my passing skill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each one knows not every science&mdash;none there is that all things knows:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On yon tree are leaves how many?&mdash;Vahuca, how many fruit?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, how many are there fallen?&mdash;one above a hundred, there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One leaf is there 'bove a hundred&mdash;and one fruit, O Vahuca!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Those two branches if thou gather&mdash;and the twigs that on them grow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On those two are fruits two thousand&mdash;and a hundred, less by five."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, when he had check'd the chariot&mdash;answered Vahuca the king,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Charioteer! on earth thine equal&mdash;Vahuca, there may not be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By thy guidance, skilled in horses!&mdash;to Vidarbha I would go:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I in thee have placed reliance&mdash;interrupt not then our course:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Willingly will I obey thee&mdash;Vahuca, in what thou ask'st,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If this day we reach Vidarbha&mdash;ere the sun hath sunk in night."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vahuca replied, "No sooner&mdash;have I numbered yonder fruit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Vidarbha will I hasten&mdash;grant me then my prayer, O king."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the raja, all reluctant&mdash;"Stay then, and begin to count;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of one branch one part, O blameless&mdash;from the tall Vibhitak tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man of truth, begin to number&mdash;and make glad thine inmost heart."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the chariot quick alighting&mdash;Nala tore the branch away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, his soul possess'd with wonder&mdash;to the raja thus he said;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Having counted, an thou sawest&mdash;even so many fruits there are,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of that wonder-working science&mdash;fain the secret would I hear."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the raja spake in answer&mdash;eager to pursue his way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I of dice possess the science&mdash;and in numbers thus am skilled."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span><span class="i0">Vahuca replied; "That science&mdash;if to me thou wilt impart,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then the raja Rituparna&mdash;by his pressing need induced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eager for that skill in horses&mdash;"Be it so," thus 'gan to say;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Well, O Vahuca, thou speakest&mdash;thou my skill in dice receive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of steeds thy wondrous knowledge&mdash;be to me a meet return."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rituparna, all his science&mdash;saying this, to Nala gave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon as he in dice grew skilful&mdash;Kali from his body passed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He Karkotaka's foul poison&mdash;vomiting from out his mouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went from forth his body Kali<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>&mdash;tortured by that fiery curse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nala, wasted by that conflict&mdash;came not instant to himself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, released from that dread venom&mdash;Kali his own form resumed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Nishadha's monarch, Nala&mdash;fain would curse him in his ire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him addressed the fearful Kali&mdash;trembling, and with folded hands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Lord of men, restrain thine anger&mdash;I will give thee matchless fame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Indrasena's wrathful mother&mdash;laid on me her fatal curse,[126]<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When by thee she was deserted&mdash;since that time, O king of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have dwelt in thee in anguish&mdash;in the ecstacy of pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the King of Serpents' poison&mdash;I have burned by night, by day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thy mercy now for refuge&mdash;flee I, hear my speech, O king:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">If thou wilt not curse me, trembling&mdash;and to thee for refuge fled."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus addressed, the royal Nala&mdash;all his rising wrath suppressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fearful Kali entered&mdash;in the cloven Vibhitak tree:<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To no eyes but those of Nala&mdash;visible, had Kali spoken.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the monarch of Nishadha&mdash;from his inward fever freed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When away had vanished Kali&mdash;when the fruits he had numbered all,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span><span class="i0">Triumphing in joy unwonted&mdash;blazing in his splendour forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proudly mounting on the chariot&mdash;onward urged the rapid steeds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that tree by Kali entered&mdash;since that time stands aye accursed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those fleet horses, forward flying&mdash;like to birds, again, again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All his soul elate with transport&mdash;Nala swifter, swifter drove;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his face towards Vidarbha&mdash;rode the raja in his pride:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when forward Nala journeyed&mdash;Kali to his home returned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So released from all his sufferings&mdash;Nala went, the king of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dispossessed by Kali, wanting&mdash;only now his proper form.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For his return so long, so late&mdash;impatient, oh by me undone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My footsteps' sound he seemed to know&mdash;and thus the aged hermit said,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Most holy ones, unknowingly&mdash;a deed of awful guilt I've done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bow in hand I took my way&mdash;along Sarayu's pleasant brink,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A sound came murmuring to my ear&mdash;'twas of the urn that slowly filled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I deemed some savage wild-beast near&mdash;my erring shaft thy son had killed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A feeble groan I heard, his breast&mdash;was pierced by that dire arrow keen:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All trembling to the spot I pressed&mdash;lo there thy hermit boy was seen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flew to the sound my arrow, meant&mdash;the wandering elephant to slay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toward the river brink it went&mdash;and there thy son expiring lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fatal shaft when forth I drew&mdash;to heaven his parting spirit soared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dying he only thought of you&mdash;long, long, your lonely lot deplored.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus ignorantly did I slay&mdash;your child beloved, Oh hermit sage!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn thou on me, whose fated day&mdash;is come, thy all-consuming rage.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He heard my dreadful tale at length&mdash;he stood all lifeless, motionless;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then deep he groaned, and gathering strength&mdash;me his meek suppliant did address.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Kshatriya, 'tis well that thou hast turned&mdash;thy deed of murder to rehearse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Else over all thy land had burned&mdash;the fire of my wide-wasting curse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If with premeditated crime&mdash;the unoffending blood thou'dst spilt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Thunderer on his throne sublime&mdash;had shaken at such tremendous guilt.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the anchorite's sacred head&mdash;hadst, knowing, aimed thy shaft accursed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In th' holy Vedas deeply read&mdash;thy skull in seven wide rents had burst.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Oh lead me to that doleful spot&mdash;where my poor boy expiring lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the shaft thy fell hand shot&mdash;of my blind age, the staff, the stay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the cold earth 'twere yet a joy&mdash;to touch my perished child again,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then to that fatal place I brought&mdash;alone that miserable pair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sightless hands, and hers I taught&mdash;to touch their boy that slumbered there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor sooner did they feel him lie&mdash;on the moist herbage coldly thrown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both with a shrill and feeble cry&mdash;upon the body cast them down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mother as she lay and groaned&mdash;addressed her boy with quivering tongue,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And I myself, by Yama's seat&mdash;companion of thy darksome way,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">So groaning deep, that wretched pair&mdash;the hermit and his wife, essayed<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Divine, with glorious body bright&mdash;in splendid car of heaven elate,<br /></span>

<h2>THE BRAHMIN'S LAMENT.</h2>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>The hostility of the kindred races of Pandu and Kuru forms
one of the great circles of Indian fable. It fills great part
of the immense poem, the Mahabharata. At this period the five
sons of Pandu and their mother Kunti have been driven into
the wilderness from the court of their uncle Dritarashtra at
N&acirc;gapur. The brothers, during their residence in the forest,
have an encounter with a terrible giant, Hidimba, the
prototype of the Cyclops of Homer, and of the whole race of
giants of northern origin, who, after amusing our ancestors,
children of larger growth, descended to our nurseries, from
whence they are now well-nigh exploded. After this adventure
the brothers take up their residence in the city of Ekachara,
where they are hospitably received in the house of a Brahmin.
The neighbourhood of this city is haunted by another terrible
giant, Baka, whose cannibal appetite has been glutted by a
succession of meaner victims. It is now come to the Brahmin's
turn to furnish the fatal banquet; they overhear the
following complaint of their host, whose family, consisting
of himself, his wife, a grown up daughter, and a son a little
child, must surrender one to become the horrible repast of
the monster. In turn, the father, the mother, in what may be
fairly called three singularly pathetic Indian elegies,
enforce each their claim to the privilege of suffering for
the rest.</p></div>

<h2><a name="THE_DELUGE" id="THE_DELUGE"></a>THE DELUGE.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The following extract from the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata was published by
Bopp, with a German translation, (the promised Latin version
has not yet reached this country,) with four other extracts
from the same poem. It is inserted here not on account of its
poetical merit, but on account of the interest of the
subject. It is the genuine, and probably the earliest,
version of the Indian tradition of the Flood. The author has
made the following observations on this subject in the
Quarterly Review, which he ventures here to transcribe.</p>

<p>Nothing has thrown so much discredit on oriental studies,
particularly on the valuable Asiatic Researches, as the fixed
determination to find the whole of the Mosaic history in the
remoter regions of the East. It was not to be expected that,
when the new world of oriental literature was suddenly
disclosed, the first attempts to explore would be always
guided by cool and dispassionate criticism. Even Sir W. Jones
was led away, at times, by the ardour of his imagination; and
the gorgeous palaces of the Mahabadian dynasty, which were
built on the authority of the Desatir and the Dabistan, and
thrown upward into an age anterior even to the earliest
Indian civilisation, have melted away, and 'left not a wreck
behind,' before the cooler and more profound investigations
of Mr. Erskine<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>. Sir W. Jones was succeeded by Wilford, a
man of most excursive imagination, bred in the school of
Bryant, who, even if he had himself been more deeply versed
in the ancient language, would have been an unsafe guide. But
Wilford, it is well known, unfortunately betrayed to the
crafty and mercenary pundits whom he employed, the objects
which he hoped to find; and these unscrupulous interpreters,
unwilling to disappoint their employer, had little difficulty
in discovering, or forging, or interpolating, whatever might
suit his purpose. The honest candour with which Wilford, a
man of the strictest integrity, made the open and humiliating
confession of the deceptions which had been practised upon
him, ought for ever to preserve his memory from disrespect.
The fictions to which he had given currency, only retained,
and still we are ashamed to say retain, their ground in
histories of the Bible and works of a certain school of
theology, from which no criticism can exorcise an error once
established: still, however, with sensible men, a kind of
suspicion was thrown over the study itself; and the cool and
sagacious researches of men, probably <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>better acquainted with
their own language than some of the Brahmins themselves, were
implicated in the fate of the fantastic and, though
profoundly learned, ever injudicious reveries of Wilford.</p>

<p>Now, however, that we may depend on the genuineness of our
documents, it is curious to examine the Indian version or
versions of the universal tradition of the Deluge; for,
besides this extract from the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata, Sir W. Jones had
extracted from the Bhagavata Purana another, and, in some
respects, very different legend. Both of these versions are
strongly impregnated with the mythological extravagance of
India; but the Purana, one of the Talmudic books of Indian
tradition, as M. Bopp observes, is evidently of a much later
date than the ruder and simpler fable of the old Epic. It
belongs to a less ancient school of poetry, and a less
ancient system of religion. While it is much more exuberant
in its fiction, it nevertheless betrays a sort of
apprehension lest it shall shock the less easy faith of a
more incredulous reader; it is manifestly from the religious
school of the follower of Vishnu, and, indeed, seems to have
some reference to one of the philosophic systems. Yet the
outline of the story is the same. In the M&aacute;h&aacute;bharatic
version, Manu, like Noah, stands alone in an age of universal
depravity. His virtues, however, are of the Indian cast&mdash;the
most severe and excruciating penance by which he extorts, as
it were, the favour of the deity<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>.</p></div>

<span class="i0">In his might and kingly power&mdash;Manu, and in earthly bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in wonder-working penance&mdash;sire and grandsire far surpassed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his arms on high outstretching&mdash;wrought the sovereign of men,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With his downward head low-drooping&mdash;with his fixed, unwavering eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dreed he thus his awful penance&mdash;many a long and weary year.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the penitent with tresses&mdash;streaming loose, and wet, and long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the margin of Wirini&mdash;thus the fish began to speak:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Blessed! lo, the least of fishes&mdash;of the mighty fish in dread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou not from death preserve me&mdash;thou that all thy vows fulfill'st?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Speaking thus the fish when heard he&mdash;full of pity all his heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his hand that fish king Manu&mdash;son of Vivaswata took.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought the son of Vivaswata&mdash;to the river shore the fish,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then the fish from out the vessel&mdash;blessed Manu took again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with gentle speed he bare him,&mdash;Manu, to a spacious lake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There the conqueror of cities,&mdash;mighty Manu, cast him in.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still he grew, that fish so wondrous&mdash;many a circling round of years.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three miles long that lake expanded&mdash;and a single mile its breadth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet that fish with eyes like lotus&mdash;there no longer might endure;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor, O sovereign of the Vaisyas!&mdash;might that lake his bulk contain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spake again that fish to Manu&mdash;as he saw him, thus he spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Bring me now, O blest and holy!&mdash;to the Ganga, ocean's bride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me dwell in her wide waters&mdash;yet, O loved one, as thou wilt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be it so; whate'er thy bidding,&mdash;murmur would beseem me ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since through thee, O blest and blameless!&mdash;to this wondrous bulk I've grown."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus addressed, the happy Manu&mdash;took again the fish, and bore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the sacred stream of Ganga&mdash;and himself he cast him in.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still it grew, as time rolled onward&mdash;tamer of thy foes! that fish.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spake again that fish to Manu&mdash;as he saw him, thus he spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Mightiest! I can dwell no longer&mdash;here in Ganga's narrow stream;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Best of men! once more befriend me&mdash;bear me to the ocean swift."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Manu's self from Ganga's water&mdash;took again that wondrous fish,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he brought him to the ocean,&mdash;with his own hand cast him in.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought by Manu to the ocean&mdash;very large that fish appeared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not yet of form unmeasured,&mdash;spread delicious odours round.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that fish by kingly Manu&mdash;cast into the ocean wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In these words again bespake him&mdash;and he smiled as thus he spake:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Therefore what I now forewarn thee&mdash;may thy highest weal secure.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the fixed and all the moving&mdash;all that stirs, or stirreth not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, of all the time approaches&mdash;the tremendous time of doom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Build thyself a ship, O Manu&mdash;strong, with cables well prepared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thyself, with the seven Sages&mdash;mighty Manu enter in.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the living seeds of all things&mdash;by the Brahmins named of yore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Place thou first within thy vessel&mdash;well secured, divided well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From thy ship keep watch, O hermit&mdash;watch for me, as I draw near;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Horned shall I swim before thee&mdash;by my horn thou'lt know me well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This the work thou must accomplish,&mdash;I depart; so fare thee well&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over these tumultuous waters&mdash;none without mine aid can sail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubt thou not, O lofty minded!&mdash;of my warning speech the truth."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the fish thus answered Manu&mdash;"All that thou requir'st, I'll do."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus they parted, of each other&mdash;mutual leave when they had ta'en,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Manu, raja! to accomplish&mdash;all to him the fish had said.<br /></span>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> p. 3. l. 4. <i>Over, over all exalted</i>. This repetition is

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> p. 3. l. 5. <i>Holy deep-read in the Vedas</i>. All the
perfections, which, according to the opinions and laws of the Hindus,
distinguish the sovereign from the rest of mankind, are here ascribed
to the hero of the poem. The study of the Vedas must be cultivated by
the three superior castes, and ensures both temporal and eternal
beatitude. In the laws of Menu it is said, "Greatness is not conferred
by years, not by grey hairs, not by wealth, not by powerful kindred."
The divine sages have established this rule&mdash;Whoever has read the
Vedas and their Angas, he is among us great. (<span class="smcap">Jones's Menu</span>, ii. 254).
Of all these duties, answered Bhrigu, the principal is to acquire from
the Upanishads a true knowledge of the one supreme God: that is the
most exalted of all sciences, because it ensures immortality, (xii.
85). For in the knowledge and adoration of one God, which the Veda
teaches, all the rules of good conduct before-mentioned in order, are
fully comprised, (ib. 87.)
</p><p>
The study of the Vedas is considered the peculiar duty of kings, (vii.
43). The Upanishads are doctrinal extracts of the Vedas.
</p><p>
The Indian law demands in the most rigorous manner from every one of
noble birth, the mastery over the <i>senses</i>. Menu says, c. ii. 93, "A
man by the attachment of his organs to sensual pleasure, incurs
certain guilt; but having wholly subdued them, he thence attains
heavenly bliss. v. 94. Desire is never satisfied with the enjoyment of
desired objects; as the fire is not appeased with clarified butter; it
only blazes more vehemently. v. 97. To a man contaminated by
sensuality, neither the Vedas, nor liberality, nor sacrifices, nor
strict observances, nor pious austerities, ever procure felicity." The
control over every kind of sensual indulgence is enjoined upon the
king. vii. 44. Day and night must he strenuously exert himself to gain
complete victory over his own organs; since that king alone whose
organs are completely subdued, can keep his people firm to their duty.
</p><p>
Skill in the management of horses and chariots, which in a subsequent
part of the poem is of great importance to Nala, is often mentioned as

favourite perfection of Indian character, may be given in the words of
the author of the Bhagavat-Gita: "The highest perfection to which the
soul can attain, is action without passion. The mind is to be entirely
independent of external objects; to preserve its undisturbed serenity
it should have the conscious power of withdrawing all its senses
within itself, as the tortoise draws all its limbs beneath in shell."
Action is necessary, but action must produce no emotion&mdash;no sensation
on the calm spirit within; whatever may be their consequences, however
important, however awful, events are to be unfelt, and almost
unperceived by the impassive mind; and on this principle Arjuna is to
execute the fated slaughter upon his kindred without the least feeling
of sorrow or compunction being permitted to intrude on the divine
apathy of his soul. Some of the images in which this passionless
tranquillity of the spirit is described, appear singularly beautiful:

the representative of the human race; the holy, mythological ancestor
of the Hindus. In the Diluvium, the Indian version of the Deluge, (see
the latter part of this volume), Manu is the survivor of the human
race&mdash;the second ancestor of mankind. The first Menu is named
"Swayambhuva, or sprung from the self-existing." From him "came six
descendants, other Menus, or perfectly understanding the Scri<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>pture,
each giving birth to a race of his own, all exalted in dignity,
eminent in power." Laws of Menu, i. 61. The great code of law "the
Hindus firmly believe to have been promulged in the beginning of time
by Menu, son or grandson of Brahma, or in plain English the first of
created beings, and not the oldest only but the noblest of
legislators." Sir W. <span class="smcap">Jones's</span> preface to Laws of Menu; Works, vii. 76.
In the Ramayana, in like manner, king Dasaratha is compared to the
ancient king, Menu. The word Manu, as the name of the ancestor of men,
is derived from the Sanscrit root Man, to know (<span class="smcap">Wilson</span> in voce); in
the same manner as the Sanscrit Man&iacute;sh&aacute;, knowledge, Manushya, Man&mdash;as
also the Latin Mens, and the German Mensch. According to this
etymology, Man, Mensch, properly means "the knowing," the Being
endowed with knowledge. The German word, Meinen, to mean, or be of
opinion, belongs to the same stock.</p></div>

offerings and performed penance, by which blessings were forced from
the reluctant gods. In India not only temporal, but eternal happiness,
depends on having children. The son alone by the offering of the
Sraddha, or libation for the dead, can obtain rest for the departed
spirit of the father. Hence the begetting of a son is a religious
duty, particularly for a Brahmin, and is one of the three debts to
which he is bound during life. After he has read the Vedas in the form
prescribed by Law, has legally begotten a son, and has performed
sacrifices to the best of his power, he has paid his three debts, and
may then apply his heart to eternal bliss. <span class="smcap">Menu</span>, vi. 36. By a son a
man obtains victory over all people; by a son's son he enjoys
immortality; and afterwards, by the son of that grandson, he reaches
the solar abode. <span class="smcap">Menu</span>, ix. 137.
</p><p>
This last passage is immediately followed by the explanation of the
Sanscrit word Puttra, son, by "the deliverer from hell." Since the son
(trayat&egrave;) delivers his father from the hell, named put, he was
therefore called puttra by Brahma himself. This explanation, which it
given by the Indian etymologists, appears nevertheless, as is often
the case, rather forced; since the final syllable,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> tra, which is
translated by deliver (or preserve, <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, in voce) is a common
ending of many words, without the peculiar signification of
delivering: as with this final syllable on the word Pu, to be pure, is
formed the noun Puwitra, pure. <span class="smcap">Wilkins</span>, Grammar, p. 454; <span class="smcap">Kosegarten</span>.
The affix with which this last is formed however, is not tra, but
itra, and it affords therefore no ground of objection to the usual
etymology of Puttra. <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>.
</p><p>
The Indian poetry is full of instances of this strong desire for
offspring. In the Ramayana, king Dasaratha performs the Aswamedha, or
offering of a horse, to obtain a son. "To this magnanimous king,
acquainted in every duty, pre-eminent in virtue, and performing sacred
austerities for the sake of obtaining children, there was no son to
perpetuate his family. At length in the anxious mind of this noble one
the thought arose, 'Why do I not perform an Ushwamedha to obtain a
son.'" <span class="smcap">Carey</span> and <span class="smcap">Marshman</span>'s translation, sect. viii. p. 74. Compare
the Raghu Vansa, canto i., and all that is done by king Dilipa to
obtain a son: and the poem of the death of Hidimbha, published by
Bopp.</p></div>

the original this is a far less poetic bird, and the author must crave
forgiveness for having turned his geese into swans. If, however, we
are to believe Bohlen, in his learned work, Das Alte Indien, the
translators are altogether mistaken; they have been misled by the
similarity of the word Hansa to Gans&mdash;a goose. The original, he
asserts, to mean a mythic bird, closely resembling the swan, or
perhaps the tall and brilliant flamingo, which Southey has introduced
with such effect in one of his rich descriptions in the Curse of
Kehama. The goose, however, according to the general opinion, is so
common in Indian mythology, that this must be received with much
caution. In the modern Tamulic version of the story, translated by Mr.
Kindersley, are substituted, "Milk white Aunnays, descending from the
skies, like an undulating garland of pearls." The Aunnays are supposed
to be a sort of birds of paradise. They are represented as milk white;
remarkable for the gracefulness of their walk; and endowed with
considerable gifts. Mr. Wilson, in his Meghaduta, has given me a
precedent for the change of geese into swans; see p. 27, v. 71, with
the note. And Mr. E<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>llis, Asiatic Researches, vol. xiv. p. 29, has the
following note on the subject: "There are three distinctions of Hamsa;
the Raja-hamsa, with a milk-white body and deep red beak and legs,
this is the Phenicopteros, or flamingo; the Mallic&aacute;csha-hamsa, with
brownish beak and legs; and the Dhartarashtra-hamsa, with black beak
and legs: the latter is the European swan, the former a variety. The
gait of an elegant woman is compared by the Hindu poets to the proud
bearing of a swan in the water. Sonnerat, making a mistake similar to
that in the text, translates a passage in which this allusion occurs,
in words to the following purport, 'Her gait resembled that of a
goose.' Other writers have fallen into the same error." The swans, ou
Plut&ocirc;t les G&eacute;nies ail&egrave;s, play the same part in an extract from the
Harivansa, translated by M. Langlois, in his Monumens Litt&eacute;raires de
l'Inde, <i>Paris</i>, 1827, p. 158. The first part of the Harivansa has

of the gods, as it is here strikingly described by the poet, differs
from that of men by the absence of those defects which constitute the
inferiority of a mortal body to that of the inhabitants of the Indian
heaven. The immortal body does not perspire, it is unsoiled by dust,
the garlands which they wear stand erect, that is, the flowers are
still blooming and fresh. The gods are further distinguished by their
strong fixed gaze, and by floating on the earth without touching it.
They have no shadow. Nala's form is the opposite of all these.

gods are supposed to be exempt from the momentary elevation and

twinkle." Mr. Wilson, in his note to Vikrama and Urvasi, (Hindu
Theatre, i. 237. p. 60.), quotes this passage, and suggests that the
"marble eyes of Venus, by which Helen knew the goddess, and which the
commentators and translators seem to be much perplexed with, are
probably the 'stabdha lochana,' the fixed eyes of the Hindus, full and
unveiled for an instant, like the eyes of a marble statue." Mr. Wilson
has, I think, been misled by the words &#8001;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#956;&#945;&#961;&#956;&#945;&#7985;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;,
which rather expresses the contrary. &#924;&#945;&#961;&#956;&#945;&#7985;&#961;&#969; is to glitter,
and is applied in many places in Homer to the gleaming of armour. The

Gray, "glance their many-twinkling feet." In Mr. Wilson's curious
reference to Heliodorus (the passage is in the &AElig;thiopica, iii. 13.)
the author appears to write from Egyptian rather than Grecian notions.
He extorts, somewhat violently, a meaning from Homer's words, &#948;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#8060; &#948;&#7952; &#949;&#7985; &#7956;&#963;&#963;&#949; &#966;&#7937;&#945;&#957;&#952;&#951;&#957;, which they by no means necessarily bear;

rather an unmanageable passage; but the Latin translation has not
rendered its purport correctly. 'Upaspris' can in no case mean
'calcare:' it implies touching, and especially touching or sipping
water, as part of the ceremony of purification. As Menu; "Let each man
sprinkle the cavities of his body, and taste water in due form, etc."
In the text of this passage, 'upaspris' is used for touching or
sprinkling. In others, it is used in the sense of ablution, bathing.
In the lexicons it is explained 'upasparsa sparsam&aacute;tre,
sn&aacute;n&aacute;chamanay-orapi, touch in general, ablution, sipping water.' In
the Mit&aacute;kshara, on the subject of personal purification, the direction
is, after evacuations, 'Dwijo nityam upaspriset, Let the man of two
births always perform the upaspersa,' i. e. says the commentator,
'&aacute;ch&aacute;met, let him sip water.' The sense of the passage of the text is,
'that Nala sat down to evening prayer; (as Menu directs, he who
repeats it sitting at evening twilight, etc.,) after performing his
purifications, and sipping water, but without having washed his feet,
such ablution being necessary not because they had been soiled, but
because such an act is also part of the rite of purification. As the
Mitakshara, 'etasm&aacute;t p&aacute;da praksh&aacute;lana pr&aacute;pti, after that
purification, comes the washing of the feet,' especially prior to any
religious act. So Colebro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>oke: "Having washed his hands and feet, and

city, twelve yojanas in extent, the houses of which stood in triple
and long-extended rows. It was rich, and perpetually adorned with new
improvements; the streets and valleys were admirably disposed, and the
principal streets well watered. It was filled with merchants of
various descriptions, and adorned with abundance of jewels; difficult
of access, filled with spacious houses, beautified with gardens, and

In Indian mythology, eclipses are caused by the dragon Rahu attempting
to swallow up the moon. The origin of their hostility is given in a
passage quoted by Mr. Wilkins from the Mahabharata, in his notes to
the Bhagavat-Gita:&mdash;"And so it fell out that when the Soors were
quenching their thirst for immortality, Rahu, an Asoor, assumed the
form of a Soor, and begun to drink also; and the water had but reached
his throat, when the sun and moon, in friendship to the Soors,
discovered the deceit, and instantly Narayan cut off his head as he
was drinking, with his splendid weapon, chakra. And the gigantic head
of the Asoor, emblem of a monstrous summit, being thus separated from
his body by the chakra's edge, bounded into the heavens with a
dreadful cry, whilst the ponderous trunk fell, cleaving the ground
asunder, and shaking the whole earth unto its foundations, with all
its islands, rocks, and forest. And from this time the head of Rahu
resolved on eternal enmity, and continueth even unto this day at times
to seize upon the sun and moon." p. 149.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p></div>

Mangifern Indica. This tree is not only valuable in the estimation of

of a pupil against a tutor, almost the holiest relation of life, are
described in the Laws of Menu, ii. 191 to 218, 242, 8. "By censuring
his preceptor, though justly, he will be born an ass; by falsely
defaming him, a dog; by using his goods without leave, a small worm;
by envying his merit, a larger insect or reptile." As the Roman law

<h2><a name="THE_DESCENT_OF_THE_GANGES" id="THE_DESCENT_OF_THE_GANGES"></a>THE DESCENT OF THE GANGES.</h2>

<h3>FIRST PRINTED IN THE QUARTERLY REVIEW, VOL. XLV.</h3>
<p>The descent of the Ganges is the sequel of another fiction still more
monstrous, but perhaps one of the most singular of the cosmogonical
notions of the ancient Indians. Sagara, the king of Ayodhya (Oude),
was without offspring&mdash;in almost all eastern countries the most
grievous calamity incident to man, more especially to those of noble
or royal race. By the most surpassing penances he obtains an oracle
from the wise Brighu, predicting that one of his wives will bring
forth a single son, the other <i>sixty thousand</i>! Accordingly the fair
Cesina gives birth to Asamanja; his other wife to a gourd, which, like
the egg of Leda, is instinct with life. From the seeds of this gourd,
preserved with great care, and fed with ghee, come forth in due time
the sixty thousand boys. The son of Cesina was a youth of the most
malicious and cruel disposition; his pastime was to throw little
infants into the river, and solace himself with their cries. He is
sent into exile by his just and humane father, where he has a son,
Ansuman, as gentle and popular as Asamanja was malignant and odious.
King Sagara prepares to offer the Aswameda, the famous sacrifice of
the horse. The holy and untouched steed is led forth, as in the 'Curse
of Kehama,' among the admiring multitude, by the youthful Ansuman,
when on a sudden a monstrous serpent arises from the earth, and drags
it into the abyss. Sagara, in wrath, commands his sixty thousand sons
to undertake the recovery of the steed from the malignant demon who
has thus interrupted the sacrifice. Having searched long in vain, they
begin to dig into the bowels of the earth, until,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Cloven with shovel and with hoe, pierced by axes and by spades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrieked the earth in frantic woe; rose from out the yawning shades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yells of anguish, hideous roars from the expiring brood of hell&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Serpents, giants, and Asoors, in the deep abyss that dwell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sixty thousand leagues in length, all unweary, full of wrath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the centre, in their strength, clove they down their hellward path.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p><p>The gods, expecting the whole frame of the world, thus undermined, to
perish in total ruin, assemble around Brahma to implore his
interposition. He informs them that Vishnu, in the form of Kapila, has
been the robber of the horse, and that in due time the god will avenge
himself. From Patala, the hell of Indian mythology, the Sagarid&aelig;
recommence their impious and destructive work.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'And downward dug they many a rood, and downward till they saw aghast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the earth-bearing elephant stood, ev'n like a mountain tall and vast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis he whose head aloft sustains the broad earth's forest-clothed round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all its vast and spreading plains, and many a stately city crown'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If underneath the o'erbearing load bows down his weary head, 'tis then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mighty earthquakes are abroad, and shaking down the abodes of men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around earth's pillar moved they slowly, and thus in humble accents blest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him the lofty and the holy, that bears the region of the East.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And southward dug they many a rood, until before their shuddering sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The next earth-bearing elephant stood, huge Mahapadmas' mountain height.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his head earth's southern bound, all full of wonder, saw they rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slow and awe-struck paced they round, and him, earth's southern pillar, blest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Westward then their work they urge, king Sagara's six myriad race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto the vast earth's western verge, and there in his appointed place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The next earth-bearing elephant stood, huge Saumanasa's mountain crest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around they paced in humble mood, and in like courteous phrase addrest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still their weary toil endure, and onward dig until they see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last earth-bearing Himapandure, glorying in his majesty.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At length they reach the place where Vishnu appears in the form of
Kapila, with the horse feeding near him; a flame issues forth from the
indignant deity, and the six myriad sons of Sagara become a heap of
ashes.</p>

<p>The adventure devolves on the youthful Ansuman, who achieves it with
perfect success; Vishnu permits him to lead away the steed, but the
ashes of his brethren cannot be purified by earthly water; the goddess
Ganga must first be brought to earth, and, having undergone lustration
from that holy flood, the race of Sagara are to ascend to heaven. Yet
a long period elapses; and it is not till the reign of the virtuous
Bhagiratha, that Brahma is moved by his surpassing penance to grant
the descent of Ganga from heaven. King Bhagiratha had taken his stand
on the top of Gokarna, the sacred peak of the Himavan, (the Himalaya,)
and here</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Stands with arms outstretch'd on high, amid five blazing fires, the one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Towards each quarter of the sky, the fifth the full meridian sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mid fiercest frosts on snow he slept, the dry and withered leaves his food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mid rains his roofless vigil kept, the soul and sense alike subdued.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His prayers are irresistible; but Brahma forewarns him, that the
unbroken descent of Ganga from heaven would be so overpowering, that
the earth would be unable to sustain it, and Siva must be propitiated,
in order that he may receive on his head the precipitous cataract.
Under this wild and unwieldy allegory appears to lurk an obscure
allusion to the course of the Ganges among the summits, and under the
forests of the Himalaya, which are the locks of Siva.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'High on the top of Himav&#257;n the mighty Mashawara stood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And "Descend," he gave the word to the heaven-meandering water&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full of wrath, the mandate heard Himav&#257;n's majestic daughter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a giant's stature soaring and intolerable speed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From heaven's height down rush'd she pouring upon Siva's sacred head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him the goddess thought in scorn with her resistless might to sweep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By her fierce waves o'erborne, down to hell's remotest deep.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Siva, in his turn enraged, resists her fury.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Down on Sankara's holy head, down the holy fell, and there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the entangling meshes spread, of his loose and flowing hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vast and boundless as the woods upon the Himalaya's brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor ever may the struggling floods rush headlong to the earth below.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Opening, egress was not there, amid those winding, long meanders.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within that labyrinthine hair, for many an age the goddess wanders.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The king again has recourse to his penances, Siva is propitiated, and
the stream by seven<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> channels finds its way to the plains of India.
The spirit and the luxuriance of the description which follows, of the
king leading the way, and the obedient waters rolling after his car,
appear to us of a high order of poetry.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
